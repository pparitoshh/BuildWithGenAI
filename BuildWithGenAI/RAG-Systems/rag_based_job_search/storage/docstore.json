Are you proud of your technical skills, commercial head and ability to get shit done? You're reading the right job description. We want someone who is inspired to work in tech for good and is jumping out of bed in the morning because the idea of using their skills to improve the lives of millions of potential customers all over the world, gets them going.\n\nBefore we talk about our product and mission, let's be clear that although we're tackling men's sexual problems right now, you don't need to be a guy to apply. We want to hear from candidates of all genders. We believe that if we solve these problems, everyone will benefit.\n\nAt Mojo, we're building the first sexually intelligent generation.\n\nSexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.\n\nWe believe that good sex starts in your head, so we're not here to push pills or offer quick fixes to the 50% of Millennials and Gen Z who now suffer with psychological issues in the bedroom. Nope, hyper-personalised AI Therapists are created by the world's best sexual wellbeing specialists to help our members lead thriving and healthy relationships \ud83d\udcaa. We are looking for someone who is excited to be part of that.\n\nWe've had crazy global growth, with over 600,000 members in 150 countries and counting. We're backed by Europe's top VC firms, and you might even have seen us on the front cover of the Sunday Times.\n\nThe Role\n\nYou'll work closely with the founders, report to our Chief of Staff and take ownership of much of our data stack. You will be given free reign to spearhead new strategic data projects while helping to set data standards in the company. You'll have the opportunity to guide and enable the whole Mojo team across Product, Growth, Marketing and Ops to make good data driven decisions. Most importantly you will be in a position to identify how Mojo can have the biggest impact for our members.

Are you proud of your technical skills, commercial head and ability to get shit done? You're reading the right job description. We want someone who is inspired to work in tech for good and is jumping out of bed in the morning because the idea of using their skills to improve the lives of millions of potential customers all over the world, gets them going.\n\nBefore we talk about our product and mission, let's be clear that although we're tackling men's sexual problems right now, you don't need to be a guy to apply. We want to hear from candidates of all genders. We believe that if we solve these problems, everyone will benefit.\n\nAt Mojo, we're building the first sexually intelligent generation.\n\nSexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.\n\nWe believe that good sex starts in your head, so we're not here to push pills or offer quick fixes to the 50% of Millennials and Gen Z who now suffer with psychological issues in the bedroom. Nope, hyper-personalised AI Therapists are created by the world's best sexual wellbeing specialists to help our members lead thriving and healthy relationships \ud83d\udcaa.

Most importantly you will be in a position to identify how Mojo can have the biggest impact for our members. We are an app-first experience, meaning this impact will touch people all over the world.\n\nAs we are an early-stage start-up, there is room for you to have a huge impact on the future of the company and a large amount of autonomy to shape your role and get stuck in. You should be comfortable adapting your role and responsibilities as the company grows. We expect this might consist of:\n\n\nProviding analyses to support product, marketing or finance\nOwning tracking of business metrics by refining and maintaining reporting\nDeveloping our best practices for experimentation methodology (eg A/B testing)\nDeveloping data-driven projects, including applications of ML or modelling techniques\nWorking with leaders across Mojo to identify new opportunities in our AI product\nPerforming analyses to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic advice\nImproving business data documentation\nSupporting the refinement of our data infrastructure, architecture, and ETL processes\nCollaboratively setting standards and ways of working with Data at Mojo\nBuilding a self-serve data culture across the wider Mojo team through upskilling and accessible data tooling\n\n\nWe are building a team of people that have real ownership over the business.

We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.\u202f\n\nWe have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.\u202f\n\nTo learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.\n\nBy providing your information, you acknowledge that you have read our Applicant Privacy Notice and authorize Roku to process your data subject to those terms.\nShow more \n13, 4121330987, United Kingdom, Data Scientist, InterEx Group, 2025-01-13, https://uk.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-scientist-at-interex-group-4121330987?position=10&pageNum=0&refId=T2b3NlNGwu1UYlZ4V7Pzkg%3D%3D&trackingId=amVc%2FtLaYYLulreKTyDDFA%3D%3D, The ideal candidate's favourite words are learning, data, scale, and agility.
