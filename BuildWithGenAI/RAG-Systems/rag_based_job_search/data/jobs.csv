We believe that AI should be transparent and responsible by design, and we’re looking for versatile people who can help us create it.

As a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer, you will join the rapidly growing Engineering team at our University of Oxford machine learning company to help us realise a future where Humans and AI work together to solve the world’s most important problems.

Location: Remote (UK) or office-based (incl. mixed),

You’ll share your days with teams of talented software engineers, scientists, designers, and product specialists. Together, you will take ideas from concept through to production, making elegant and maintainable solutions to complex data-centric problems. You’ll help build an exciting portfolio of products that will have a real and positive impact on society, the defence of the realm, and the individual lives of people across the globe.

As a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer, you will be at the heart of the engineering effort that enables the delivery of state-of-the-art AI/ML in a diverse range of projects; from signal processing to geospatial data modelling to image processing and high-fidelity simulations of physical systems.

You will work with users on new features, rapidly prototyping, exploring and validating ideas, and designing and developing features for scalable, secure, and observable large distributed systems, both on-premise and in the cloud.

We grow and succeed together by working in collaborative, flexible, and self-organising remote-first teams where your passion for software engineering and product development will allow you to thrive.

Working at Mind Foundry will provide an excellent platform for you to grow, learn, and impact the world's important problems by helping us realise our vision.

As part of this role, you will be required to work away at partner locations.Typically, this will be for up to one week at a time, but on occasion may be up to three weeks, and we aim for this not to happen more than once every two months.

You shall be willing and eligible to apply and obtain UK security clearance to Security Check (SC) if not hold an existing clearance.

ABOUT YOU

We understand that no single person can do it all, and we don't expect everyone to be an expert in every aspect of frontend, backend & DevOps, but you’ll need to have skills & experience across many levels of a web app stack.

You will have at least five years of commercial software engineering experience and be an expert in at least one high-level programming language with familiarity with a range of others. We primarily use JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.

Our core technology stack is PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, and Python Machine Learning. We’d love for you to have experience in more than one of those and an understanding of Machine Learning, AI, or Data Science, including experience deploying ML in production or commercial applications. If you have equivalent experience in different technology stacks and have transferable skills, we’d still love to hear from you.

You have experience working in an iterative Agile environment and a good understanding of the DevOps movement, its tools and its culture. You will have been directly involved in helping to drive improvements to the way software is delivered in your previous roles.

You are motivated by mentoring and developing less experienced staff.

You have experience architecting and designing complex distributed software systems for the cloud and on-premise environments. You’ll understand different architectural patterns and the reasons for using them and be able to design secure and scalable systems.

You have a broad set of additional software engineering skills, for example, systems integration, scripting, CI/CD, UI/UX, design, and databases.

You have worked closely with users, working out what to build and why, and ideally, you will have had experience working closely with clients and representing technical expertise in discussions with other technical experts.

You keep on top of trends and new technologies and are a leader and mentor in your area of expertise. You are able to express your ideas clearly for audiences with differing levels of technical expertise. Perhaps you’ve written blogs or spoken at conferences.

We’d love it if you have experience in the following areas. If you’re already an expert, even better!


Familiarity with other technologies in our stack like protobuf/grpc, FastAPI, AWS
Experience with modern numeric or big data frameworks, such as Sklearn, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Spark, Numba, Kafka, Apache Arrow, Parquet
Kubeflow or other MLOps technologies
We'll often need to integrate our software with external systems, so some experience integrating with software APIs and skills like networking configuration would be really useful to have.
User interface design and implementation, especially with React and Typescript


We would love to hear from you if this sounds like you and what you believe you can achieve."

The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.

The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 plus people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.

The Role

We are seeking a Senior Research Assistant to support analysis on the resilience of the UK banking sector and the evolving risks that it faces. Working in a friendly and collaborative team, you will support analysts and technical specialists with data queries for policy work and research. You will also have opportunities to develop expertise on the UK banking sector, get involved in policy work, and build programming and data science skills.

Department Overview

The Financial Stability Strategy and Risk (FSSR) Directorate works towards a financial system that serves households and businesses in bad times as well as good. The directorate is responsible for identifying cross-cutting risks to UK financial stability, assessing the resilience of the UK financial sector, and developing policy solutions to ensure UK financial stability. Our work sits at the heart of the Bank of England’s mission.

The Bank Stress Testing and Resilience (BSTAR) Group within FSSR assesses systemic risks to and from the banking system. That includes analysing the outlook for banks and the risks they face, as well as assessing appropriate policy design choices. We are a group of friendly staff from a wide range of backgrounds and subject areas.

The Team

The Risk and Resilience Team monitors trends in the banking sector and investigates cutting-edge issues and risks to financial stability. We provide the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) with topical analysis for their quarterly discussions. The team also undertakes medium-term analysis to improve policy setting, including on (i) developing a framework to assess whether changes in UK bank lending are warranted by the macroeconomic environment, (ii) improving our knowledge of banks’ exposures to the non-bank financial sector, and (iii) developing a model with feedback loops between the real economy and banking system. Due to the nature of our work, the team often collaborates and works closely with colleagues across other parts of the Bank – such as the Prudential Regulation Authority, Monetary Analysis, and Markets – as well as external stakeholders such as the Financial Conduct Authority and HM Treasury.

Job Description

As a Senior Research Assistant, you will have opportunities to:


Develop expertise on the UK banking sector and gain valuable hands-on experience working with large and complex datasets.
Develop your technical ability and programming skills, including learning to apply data science techniques.
Lead on aspects of data work for the department, including for external publications such as the Financial Stability Report.
Support analysts with data queries, policy and research work, and the preparation of staff presentations to the FPC.
Help drive the department’s data strategy and infrastructure.
Build effective relationships with internal and external data providers.


Minimum Criteria:


A desire to learn about financial stability issues and support UK financial stability.
Excellent working knowledge of Excel, PowerPoint and Word.
Good numerical and computational skills and independent problem-solving abilities.
Strong organisational skills and the ability to work independently.
Good communication and interpersonal skills.
Willingness to learn to produce analysis in R, and passion to develop programming skills.
Experience handling large datasets and presenting data effectively.


Desirable Criteria:


Previous experience working as a research assistant or equivalent role.
Knowledge of banks’ financial accounts and regulatory or financial market data.
Experience using different data platforms (e.g. Bloomberg, Eikon).
Prior experience using R or a similar programming language.


Our Approach to Inclusion

The Bank values diversity, equity and inclusion. We play a key role in maintaining monetary and financial stability, and to do that effectively, we believe we need a workforce that reflects the society we serve.

At the Bank of England we want all colleagues to feel valued and respected, so we're working hard to build an inclusive culture which supports people from all backgrounds and communities to be at their best at work. We celebrate all forms of diversity, including (but not limited to) age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status. We believe that it’s by drawing on different perspectives and experiences that we’ll continue to make the best decisions for the public.

We welcome applications from individuals who work flexibly, including job shares and part time working patterns. We've also partnered with external organisations to support us in making adjustments for candidates and employees in the recruitment process where they're needed.

For most roles where work can be carried out at home, we aim for colleagues to spend half of their time in the office, with a minimum of 40% per month. Subject to that minimum requirement, individuals and managers should work together to find what works best for them, their team and stakeholders.

Finally, we're proud to be a member of the Disability Confident Scheme. If you wish to apply under this scheme, you should check the box in the ‘Candidate Personal Information’ under the ‘Disability Confident Scheme’ section of the application.

In addition, we also offer a comprehensive benefits package as detailed below:


 A non-contributory, career average pension giving you a guaranteed retirement benefit of 1/95th of your annual salary for every year worked. There is the option to increase your pension (to 1/50th) or decrease (to 1/120th) in exchange for salary through our flexible benefits programme each year.

Are you interested in joining a team that will help shape and deliver the future of Capital Markets at the FCA?

The team/department

We are looking to fill a Senior Associate role in the Capital Markets Department within the Supervision, Policy and Competition Division at the FCA. The Capital Markets Department focuses on supervision and policy relating to key aspects of wholesale financial markets, including primary markets, credit ratings and benchmark providers, trading conduct and transparency, and wholesale Cryptoasset markets. We have a key role in delivering the FCA’s 3-year strategic priority to strengthen our wholesale markets and ensure that the UK continues to be regarded as one of the leading global markets of choice for issuers, intermediaries and investors, when compared to other high-quality markets.

The team also has policy responsibility for other forms of capital raising activity, such as crowdfunding.

The team also leads on sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) related financial disclosures by listed companies, for example our rules requiring companies to report annually based on the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.

Life at UiPath

The people at UiPath believe in the transformative power of automation to change how the world works. We’re committed to creating category-leading enterprise software that unleashes that power.

To make that happen, we need people who are curious, self-propelled, generous, and genuine. People who love being part of a fast-moving, fast-thinking growth company. And people who care—about each other, about UiPath, and about our larger purpose

Could that be you?

Your Mission

As an applied scientist, you'll work at the intersection between research and product. You'll build, optimize and deploy machine learning models as well as scale them up.

We’re looking for people who love machine learning and computer science, are interested in the theory behind the models, and are motivated to solve real world problems with techniques that are scalable, efficient, and reliable in production.

The ideal candidate is someone who has conducted and applied machine learning research of substantial practical importance. This position entails designing and executing large-scale experiments on complex infrastructure, requiring strong experimental intuition and programming skills. Beyond that, you need to be kind, courteous, motivated, self-starting, honest and responsible.

Background:

This role is with UiPath advanced machine learning research group. We focus on building large multi-modal models that can take action and move us closer to useful general intelligence. We are machine learning researchers and engineers working to solve the hard problem of getting machines to use software like humans do.

What You'll Do At UiPath


Build and improve modern machine learning models to solve complex ML problems. 
Read papers, propose model improvements, implement and test the new models. 
Productionize the best performing models in a scalable and efficient manner. 
Collaborate with research scientists to scale model training to hundreds of GPUs. 
Think about the best human-computer interfaces to make machine learning models accessible to everyone. 
Run regular benchmarks and perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your research-based optimizations and present your findings to the team. 
Stay up to date with the latest research and technology and communicate your knowledge throughout the company. 
Mentor other members of the team and help hire new people. 


What You'll Bring To The Team


A Master’s degree or PhD in Machine Learning, Computer Science or a related field. 
Software development experience programming in Python and modern ML libraries like PyTorch, Tensorflow, or JAX. 
Experience solving real problems with Transformers and “modern” architectures. 
Experience with at least other programming language (e.g. Rust / C++ etc.)
Knowledge and appreciation of statically typed languages and using type systems to catch bugs early, rather than at runtime. 
Ability to implement models from academic papers like ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, etc. 
Strong quantitative intuition and mastery of linear algebra, probability and statistics. 
Solid knowledge of basic data structures (list, vector, stack, heap), basic algorithms (sort, search, etc.) and associated time/memory asymptotic complexity. 
Good knowledge of GNU/Linux. 


Maybe you don’t tick all the boxes above— but still think you’d be great for the job? Go ahead, apply anyway. Please. Because we know that experience comes in all shapes and sizes—and passion can’t be learned

We value a range of diverse backgrounds, experiences and ideas. We pride ourselves on our diversity and inclusive workplace that provides equal opportunities to all persons regardless of age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, national origin, disability, neurodiversity, military and/or veteran status, or any other protected classes.

Senior Simulation Research Engineer | Routing Simulation | Hatfield | Hybrid (1-2 days office) 

About us: Leading online retail into the future

Our teams are putting the world’s retailers online using robotics, AI, IoT and the cloud. We provide services to our partners globally via our state-of-the-art robotics technology, known as the Ocado Smart Platform (""OSP""). This proprietary hardware and software powers all online grocery operations - from our sophisticated webshop and highly automated Customer Fulfilment Centres, to our cutting edge last-mile operations.

About The Role

We are looking for exceptional analytical problem solvers to join our Routing Simulation team, where you will use simulation to understand the behaviour of our routing optimisation through modelling, experimentation and data analysis. You will work closely with stakeholders to offer them practical insight from simulation, and perform research to guide the design of some of our most advanced systems. Through research, experimentation and collaboration, you will become an expert in some of Ocado’s most advanced and complex technology.

Ocado’s routing decisions are some of the most complex and most valuable logic in the Ocado Smart Platform. The final deliveries (“last mile”) accounts for a significant fraction of the cost of online grocery retail, so while it’s incredibly difficult to optimise, the payoff from making better decisions is huge. The Routing Simulation team develops a simulation model which can help us make better decisions through understanding the impact of critical decisions or new algorithms. As a research specialist in the team, you will work closely with both the software engineers building the simulation and stakeholders who need insight from it.

We plan to grow the existing development team with a second research position. As well as being part of the Routing Simulation team, you’ll join a community of simulation researchers working across a range of domains in Ocado. You’ll be expected to share your insights and experience, but you’ll also get plenty of support, advice and mentorship from experts in other areas.

As a simulation researcher, you will need to be comfortable:


Liaising with stakeholders to clearly understand their requirements
Designing appropriate models, experiments and analysis to produce trustworthy data from our simulation model
Analysing large datasets in depth to build a full picture of the system performance
Noticing unusual or interesting behaviours, and running further experiments or investigations to understand these
Sharing results both verbally and in writing, providing clear yet nuanced insight in an accessible way


What We’re Looking For

You need to be highly numerate and comfortable working with data, with a keen eye for detail and the inquisitiveness and drive to understand things in depth. You’ll be a fast learner, able to quickly pick up new ideas and use a wide range of tools to solve challenging problems. We look for;


Strong analytical and reasoning skills
Professional or academic data-driven research, particularly if it involves simulation or modelling
 Python, SQL and Google BigQuery
A track record delivering significant research or analysis projects
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Ability to build effective relationships to support a wide range of stakeholders
Interest in both organisational and technical challenges
The most fundamental requirement of all is that you’re always motivated to do better, whether this means improving yourself or helping your team find better ways of working.


What Do I Get In Return


Hybrid working (2 days in the office) 
30 days work from anywhere globally 
Remote working for the month of August + 50% of December
25 days annual leave, rising to 27 days after 5 years service (plus optional holiday purchase)
Pension scheme (various options available including employer contribution matching up to 7%)
Private Medical Insurance
22 weeks paid maternity leave and 6 weeks paid paternity leave (once relevant service requirements complete)
Train Ticket loan (interest-free)
Cycle to Work Scheme
Opportunity to participate in Share save and Buy as You Earn share schemes
15% discount on Ocado.com and free delivery for all employees
Income Protection(can be up to 50% of salary for 3 years) and Life Assurance(3 x annual salary)


About Ocado Group

When our journey started, we were all about changing the way people shop for groceries. 20 years later, we’re developing our own ground breaking technology, opening multiple sites at an accelerating rate and engaging in exciting new business partnerships around the world!

Transforming an industry also means transforming the way we do business. As we continually develop new technologies and customer propositions, we’re looking for the Everyday Pioneers to lead us into the next stage of our evolution: enhancing our capabilities, inspiring our teams and developing new ways of working.

Changing the way the world shops, for good.

About The Team

The Institute for Regeneration and Repair (IRR) is a large multidisciplinary cross-college institute composed of three world-class research centres. Our scientists and clinicians study tissue regeneration and repair to advance human health and reproductive outcomes across two state-of-the-art buildings with capacity for over 1,000 staff and students. The institute provides a fertile and dynamic environment, which allows its researchers and professional services staff to flourish.

CIR

The Centre for Inflammation Research (CIR; Director, Professor David Dockrell) leverages peer-reviewed interdisciplinary research programmes and focussed collaboration, to characterise mechanisms of acute and chronic inflammation. The CIR aims to characterise what promotes health at the molecular level in order to prevent the harmful consequences of inflammation in clinical medicine.

Effort is targeted at: inhibiting the initiation of inflammation by blocking specific molecular triggers and by modulating cellular and tissue responses resulting in organ dysfunction; finding new approaches to modulate established inflammatory responses to limit tissue injury; and promoting safe resolution of inflammation to restore healthy structure and function of tissue.

A particular focus is on tissue fibrosis - the result of longstanding harmful inflammation, with programmes looking at the mechanisms underpinning resolution of fibrosis and its non-invasive monitoring and imaging.

The CIR has a broad interest in inflammatory disease in a range of tissues including in the lungs, kidney, liver, pancreas, bowel, bone, joints, skin, heart and brain. There is in-depth analysis of stimuli that induce or modify inflammation with detailed programmes considering the role of sex, development, auto-immunity, infection and other environmental influences. Importantly, the principles derived will have ready application to inflammatory and reparatory responses in virtually all physiological and pathological settings, including cancer and infection (not least COVID-19). Translation is aided by a commitment to novel diagnostic and imaging modalities and our proximity to patient groups and healthy volunteers in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh.

The CIR will be located from 2023 in state-of-the-art facilities in the Institute of Regeneration and Repair. Our research aims align closely with the vision of IRR and other centres within IRR, to promote human health through in-depth understanding of tissue regeneration and repair, while developing a multi-pronged translational programme to effect therapeutic innovation in this area. IRR is located on the BioQuarter Campus, Edinburgh.
