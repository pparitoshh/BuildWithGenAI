We want someone who is inspired to work in tech for good and is jumping out of bed in the morning because the idea of using their skills to improve the lives of millions of potential customers all over the world, gets them going.

Before we talk about our product and mission, let's be clear that although we're tackling men's sexual problems right now, you don't need to be a guy to apply. We want to hear from candidates of all genders. We believe that if we solve these problems, everyone will benefit.

At Mojo, we're building the first sexually intelligent generation.

Sexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.

We believe that good sex starts in your head, so we're not here to push pills or offer quick fixes to the 50% of Millennials and Gen Z who now suffer with psychological issues in the bedroom. Nope, hyper-personalised AI Therapists are created by the world's best sexual wellbeing specialists to help our members lead thriving and healthy relationships 💪. We are looking for someone who is excited to be part of that.

As we are an early-stage start-up, there is room for you to have a huge impact on the future of the company and a large amount of autonomy to shape your role and get stuck in. You should be comfortable adapting your role and responsibilities as the company grows. We expect this might consist of:

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

At Deliveroo, we have a world-class data and science organisation with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making.




We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. For example, how can we connect restaurants, riders and customers most efficiently in order to deliver food as quickly as possible? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?




These are just some of the tough problems we are solving at Deliveroo. There is no challenge that cannot be yours; the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers at Deliveroo belong to an expert, thoughtful, and active community with guest lecturers, a robust technical review process, a career progression framework, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.




 




The Role 




As an Operational Research Scientist, you will play a crucial role in developing, implementing, and maintaining cutting-edge products that leverage optimization techniques. Your responsibilities will involve engineering sophisticated operational research algorithms, as well as refining and updating existing systems. 




In this team, you will develop the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo’s delivery network. You will work in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. The team has independence and works on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants. We evaluate the performance of all our decision-making machines through our world-class experimentation platform.




You will report into a ML/OR Manager. This is a hybrid role that will be based in London.




 




You will:





Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real-time delays.


Enhance our simulation capabilities to more accurately predict the effects of algorithmic changes on our delivery network.


Optimise consumer and rider fees.





Also, you will work alongside people who work on:





The consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes.


Detecting fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants.


Assisting restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish.


Creating an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities.





 




Requirements:





You are someone who knows the fundamentals of operational research and when they should be applied through a relevant PhD or work experience.


Proven experience in developing and applying optimization models, algorithms, and metaheuristic techniques in a logistics or supply chain context.


You can translate fuzzy logistics and delivery problems or objectives into a well-thought-out algorithmic solution. You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.


Strong programming skills in one of the languages such as Python, Rust, C, C++, or Java, with a focus on algorithm design rather than software engineering.


Experience in combinatorial optimisation problems.


A bias to simplicity, where you care most about achieving impact.





Nice to haves: 





Experience in solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and/or building large scale delivery network simulations


Experience in discrete event simulations


Experience in any of the following areas: algorithms and data structures, parallel and distributed computing, high-performance computing 





Why Deliveroo




Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.




We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & Benefits




At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




Diversity




At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.
